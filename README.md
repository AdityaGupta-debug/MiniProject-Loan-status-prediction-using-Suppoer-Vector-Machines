## 📊 About the Dataset – Loan Approval Prediction

### 🏦 Context

This dataset is widely used to train machine learning models that **predict whether a loan application will be approved or not**.  
It reflects the kind of data collected by **banks and financial institutions** when evaluating **personal loan eligibility**.

The dataset includes **applicant details** such as income, credit history, employment status, and more — all critical factors in deciding loan approval.  
The target variable is `Loan_Status`, which indicates whether the loan is **approved (Y)** or **not approved (N)**.

### 📦 Content

Each row represents a **unique loan application**.  
The dataset contains a mix of **categorical and numerical features**, making it an excellent resource for:

- 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- 🧮 Feature Engineering  
- 🤖 Classification Modeling

### 🧾 Column Descriptions

- 🆔 `Loan_ID` – Unique loan identifier  
- 🙋 `Gender` – Applicant’s gender (`Male`, `Female`)  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 `Married` – Marital status (`Yes`, `No`)  
- 🎓 `Education` – Education level (`Graduate`, `Not Graduate`)  
- 👨‍💼 `Self_Employed` – Employment status (`Yes`, `No`)  
- 💵 `ApplicantIncome` – Applicant’s monthly income  
- 💸 `CoapplicantIncome` – Co-applicant’s monthly income  
- 💰 `LoanAmount` – Requested loan amount (in thousands)  
- 📅 `Loan_Amount_Term` – Loan repayment term (in months)  
- 🧾 `Credit_History` – Credit history (`1.0` = good, `0.0` = bad)  
- 🏠 `Property_Area` – Property location (`Urban`, `Semiurban`, `Rural`)  
- 🏷️ `Loan_Status` – **Target variable**: Loan approval status (`Y`, `N`)  

---

### 🎯 Target Variable

- **`Loan_Status`** – Indicates whether a loan application was **approved (`Y`)** or **rejected (`N`)**
